        Uses a heuristic to find the best tax lot to sell.

        1. Loss Lots

        We first try to find a loss lot to sell, in the following order:

            for any loss lot less than 30 days old:
                the oldest lot that has not been adjusted by a wash sale
            for any loss lot less than 30 days old:
                the oldest lot
            for any loss lot:
                the highest-loss lot

        This algorithm prioritizes "stamping out" recent high-cost lots that
        are eligible to be adjusted and thus act to disallow a loss.

        This assumes a "no lot may be adjusted more than once" interpretation
        of 26 CFR ยง 1.1091-1 (e)

        2. Gain Lots

        If we are forced to sell at a gain, we sort on the sum of:
            the actual capital gains to be paid per share
        and
            the "accrued tax dividend" (ATD)

        In the case of US ST/LT gains, the ATD is defined as the difference
        between the dollar value of the short and long term capital gains,
        times the fraction of the long term holding period that has elapsed.

        The ATD peaks one day short of LT holding, but is zero for LT lots, for
        which the dividend has been "paid" for that lot to our IRS tax owed
        account.

        This biases us toward selling more recent short term lots if we are
        forced to sell short term, allowing near-long-term lots to "ripen".
