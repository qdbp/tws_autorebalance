"""
This file defines primitives to ensure financial security throughout the
application by validating that quantities representing financial risk, such as
trade size, loan size, etc., are bounds-checked at the time of calculation.

The goal is to ensure operational security and satisfaction of risk constraints.
This differs and complements standard bounds-checking, which should still be
used throughout to validate the mathematical soundness of program logic.

In order to keep security policies as concise as possible, this module should
not care if parameters are unreasonable in a non-dangerous direction. e.g. the
rebalance threshold is so high the program never trades.
